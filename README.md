# Lit ECDSA Combine

Portable lightweight recombination client application for threshold ECDSA developed by Lit Protocol.

# Tests

All tests use known results from threshold signatures generated by Lit Protocol's network of nodes, though any ECDSA threshold signature shares that are hex formatted should work appropriately.

# Generating JS SDK code.

Use build.sh to generate base64 encrypted versions of the output binary to be included into the LIT JS SDK.
